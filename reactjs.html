      <h2>What is React</h2>
      <p>
        React or React JS, is a javascript library which is used to design user
        frontend in web applications. It powers the View layer of the MVC
        architecture
      </p>

      <h2>When to use React Js</h2>
      <p>
        React is used to create a robust frontend applications or UserInterfaces
        across multiple platforms.This library can run on any platform. It helps
        in creating scalable applications with less error. The main reason also
        to react is because of its documentation as its very vast and very easy
        to understand.Even they have a tutorial section where we can practice
        react applicaitons over a sandbox and also learn the concepts meanwhile.

        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>Virtual DOM</h2>
        <p>
            The document object model (DOM) is the main part that represents 
            the complete skeleton of a web page document in any web application. 
            It defines the logical structure of an HTML or XML document or page 
            
            and how they are accessed and updated or changed, enabling application developers 
            to target particular elements and objects with a document directly.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Flow</h2>
        <p>Data flow in react is handled according to property of flow down. React passes down  a set 
of immutable values/data to the components
 renderer as properties of that component. The component 
 does not directly update these properties,
  and developers can make use of a call-back
   function to request for changes.</p>
      </p>

      <h2>Components</h2>

      <p>Components is the core main building blocks of the react library.
          These components are analogous to JavaScript functions. Each components accept the defined input and renders or take descions according the that given piece of data.
        This approach of component creation helps developer to create reusable components and use it everywhere in the program.This also stops or make less repetions for the robust code.</p>
