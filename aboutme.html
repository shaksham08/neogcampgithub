        My main intrest is in core software development. I have a great intrest
        in Javascript which i think is an amazing language.I have also worked
        over mobile applications using react native. Apart from technology i
        love travelling and cooking. I my mean time i really love to go out and
        taste or try some of the local foods and dishes. You can also view my
        intrest or see my projects by visiting my portfolio link. THere i have

      <h2>Future Dreams</h2>
      <p>
        Coming to my future dreams,i really want to visit most of the contry
        outside india specially northern america and that too the countryside.
        Very eager to know about them, their culture their food and the way of
        living. Rather than spending time in an expensive hotel , i would love
        to stay somewhere in countryside
